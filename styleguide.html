  <h1>Gadget styles example usage</h1>

  <p>
    This repository defines some common styles for <a href="http://versal.com">Versal</a> gadgets. Such gadgets are typically instantiated inside an iframe, so it is the developer's responsibility to include styles that makes the gadget look consistent with other gadgets. This repo helps with that.
  </p>

  <p>
    This style guide is still in its infancy, we will update it along with the CSS to show how to use it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that this style guide is probably going to be unorthodox. Gadgets are unlike regular pages on the web, they typically contain no pre-set text, except for some labels. This is because they are meant to be customized by authors of Versal courses. Therefore, you will not find regular typographic components as seen in most style guide, but mostly elements for making dynamic interfaces.
  </p>

  <h2>Elements</h2>

  <p><button>Default button</button></p>

  <p><input type="text" value="Text box"></p>

  <p><textarea>Text area</textarea></p>

  <p><select><option>Select</option></select></p>
